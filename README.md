# Blockchain-based Job Portal: Decentralized Career Connect

## ðŸ§© Project Description
Decentralized Career Connect is a blockchain-based job portal that removes the need for intermediaries. It allows employers to post jobs and job seekers to apply directly through the blockchain network â€” ensuring transparency, immutability, and trust.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To create a transparent and tamper-proof job marketplace where candidates and employers interact directly using blockchain smart contracts.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Job Posting:** Employers can post job listings with descriptions and salary details.
- **Job Application:** Applicants can apply to posted jobs with an IPFS-stored resume link.
- **Data Integrity:** All job data and applications are stored immutably on the blockchain.
- **Transparency:** Employers can see applications only for their jobs.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Integration with **IPFS** for decentralized resume storage.
- Adding **reputation or rating systems** for both employers and applicants.
